     * Note from LearnRoadRunner.com:
     * The velocity and acceleration constraints were calculated based on the following equation:
     * ((MAX_RPM / 60) * GEAR_RATIO * WHEEL_RADIUS * 2 * Math.PI) * 0.85
     * Resulting in 52.48180821614297 in/s.
     * This is only 85% of the theoretical maximum velocity of the bot, following the recommendation above.
     * This is capped at 85% because there are a number of variables that will prevent your bot from actually
     * reaching this maximum velocity: voltage dropping over the game, bot weight, general mechanical inefficiences, etc.
     * However, you can push this higher yourself if you'd like. Perhaps raise it to 90-95% of the theoretically
     * max velocity. The theoreticaly maximum velocity is 61.74330378369762 in/s.
     * Just make sure that your bot can actually reach this maximum velocity. Path following will be detrimentally
     * affected if it is aiming for a velocity not actually possible.
     *
     * The maximum acceleration is somewhat arbitrary and it is recommended that you tweak this yourself based on
     * actual testing. Just set it at a reasonable value and keep increasing until your path following starts
     * to degrade. As of now, it simply mirrors the velocity results in 52.48180821614297 in/s/s
     *
     * Maximum Angular Velocity is calculated as: maximum velocity / (trackWidth / 2) * (180 / Math.PI)
